## Hi there 👋

My name is Sergi, and I am a Blockchain, cryptography and Fintech enthusiast. Here you can find some of my personal and public projects, such as:

- 🔏 [xrpl-kms](https://github.com/shierve/aws-kms-xrp-signing): [2022] NPM library to sign transactions for the XRP Ledger using AWS KMS, and a post on all the cryptography behind it.
- 🗳️ [nem-voting](https://github.com/shierve/nem-voting): [2019] NPM library adding the functionality to vote on the NEM blockchain. Used by the official NEM wallet.
- 🛠️ [nem-trezor](https://github.com/shierve/nem-trezor): [2018] NEM integration with Trezor hardware wallet. Used by the official NEM wallet.
- 🐿️ [cryptopals](https://github.com/shierve/cryptopals-fsharp): [2018] Solutions to the Cryptopals cryptography challenges in F#.

I occasionally post about Blockchain and cryptography on [dev.to](https://dev.to/shierve) such as my [series on Cryptography for programmers](https://dev.to/shierve/cryptography-for-programmers-1-basics-block-cryptography-1iei).
